# NFT Minting App

### **1. Project Title**

**NFT Minting App on Stacks Blockchain**

---

### **2. Project Description**

This project is a **simple Clarity smart contract** that allows the creation (minting) of unique **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)** on the **Stacks blockchain**.
It includes:

* Minting NFTs (restricted to contract owner)
* Retrieving the owner of a specific NFT ID

The contract follows the **SIP-009 NFT Standard**, ensuring compatibility with wallets and marketplaces.

---

### **3. Project Vision**

To provide a **lightweight, developer-friendly starting point** for NFT-based projects on the Stacks blockchain, focusing on simplicity and compliance with existing NFT standards.

---

### **4. Future Scope**

* Add NFT transfer functionality between users.
* Store NFT metadata such as images, descriptions, and attributes.
* Implement royalty payments for creators.
* Integrate with NFT marketplaces like Gamma or Boom.
* Develop a frontend dApp for minting and viewing NFTs.

### **5. Contract Address**

`ST1234EXAMPLENFTMINT5678ADDR`
*(Replace with actual address after deployment)*

If you want, I can also **extend this with metadata support** so the minted NFTs can display images and descriptions on marketplaces, while still keeping it minimal. Would you like me to do that next?
